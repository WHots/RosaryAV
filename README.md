# RosaryAV - Lightweight Threat Detection

## Overview
RosaryAV is a nascent threat detection solution designed with a focus on efficiency and minimal resource usage. This user-side project serves as an open-source reference for developers with similar interests in cybersecurity and system protection. Our goal is to provide a foundation for detecting potential threats in a non-invasive manner, paving the way for a future transition into a comprehensive anti-virus solution.

## Current Focus
- **Threat Detection**: Custom methodologies of heuristic & triage methods to identify potential system threats.
- **Performance**: Ensuring low resource consumption and minimal impact on user experience.

## Future Direction
The project aims to evolve into a full-fledged threat removal tool. The final product, which will encompass both user-mode and kernel-mode environments, will not be open-source but instead offered as a paid service.

## Contribution
We welcome contributions from individuals who share our vision of a safer digital environment. If you're working on similar projects or have insights that could propel RosaryAV forward, please consider contributing.

## License
This project is currently open-source for educational and collaborative purposes. The licensing for the final product will be determined as the project matures.

## Acknowledgments
Shoutout to [OALabs](https://www.openanalysis.net/) They have an excellent communitity for learning reverse engineering, a lot of these guys are professionals that have actual insider knowledge of this line of work from a career standpoint, unlike other forums you may come across which are full of randoms sh*t posting pasted code for clout.
